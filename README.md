# Group C Simulation Work
This project is to simulate the Operating CPU Scheduling algorithms.

## How to install and run the program
* Step 1: Create a new folder/ directory
* step 2: Download/ Clone the app
* Step 3: Open the folder using your favorite text editor.
* Step 4: Open the terminal and make sure your in the folder directory.
* Step 5: Create a virtual Environment
* Step 6: Activate the virtual environment
* Step 7: Type pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal
* Step 8: use the command flask --app run Simulation --debug to run the development server.

## Programs Simulated
### Operating Sytem CPU schduling algorithms
-First come First Serve
-Shortest Job First(Preemptive)
-Shortest Job First(Nonpreemptive)
