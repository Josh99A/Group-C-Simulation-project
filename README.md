# Group C Simulation Work
This project is to simulate the Operating CPU Scheduling algorithms.

## How to install and run the program
* step 1: Download the zip file/ Clone the app
* step 2: Extract the zip file if downloaded
* Step 3: Open the folder created using your favorite text editor.
* Step 4: Open the terminal and make sure your in the folder directory.
* Step 5: Create a virtual Environment
* Step 6: Activate the virtual environment
* Step 7: Type pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal
* Step 8: Run the command flask --app Simulation init-db to initialise the database
* Step 9: use the command flask --app Simulation run --debug  to run the development server.

## Programs Simulated
